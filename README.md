SpaceX promotes the launch of its Falcon 9 rocket on its website at a price of $62 million, which is considerably lower than the prices of other providers who charge $165 million or more. This is mainly because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the rocket. To estimate the cost of a launch, it is important to predict if the first stage can be reused. As a data scientist working for a new rocket company named Space Y, our goal is to determine the price of each launch using the data of SpaceX available online.
